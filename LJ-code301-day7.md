I finished up all the TODO's from "build-form", all the functionality with handlebars, and got the article to produce that json
label for the manual database assignment. ALTHOUGH I have an annoying bug that does not want to fade away into the abyss. It keeps
appending a new article everytime a "change" occures in the form. I'm guessing the "ArticleView.js" is running a method that
keeps adding to the body. Couldn't find the problem hopefully someone helps me out in the morning before the lecture.
