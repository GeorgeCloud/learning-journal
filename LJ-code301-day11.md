I finally got postgres to link with homebrew so that was cool. Currently I've been trying to get used to the syntax of Postgres instead of using MySQL and learning the different commands.

The lecture from yesterday was really insightful on the way we should think of how the server handles things regarding the backend with the front using the MVC model and also the CRUD model.
