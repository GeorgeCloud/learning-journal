I deployed my second heroku app yesterday without any problems with just a basic index.html and a normal javascript file
to handle requests from a client. Today for the lab I created a new table and manually inserted 5 books that each had an authors,
title, ibsn, image_url, and a description of the book. After that I pushed the local Postgres database to my Heroku app so I could
use the database to populate it onto the homepage with handlebars.
