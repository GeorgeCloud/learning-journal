Today I used localStorage for the second time which consisted of using it to grab articles and append it to local so we 
wouldnt have to reload the page. Right now Im reviewing Ajax(url, ..., ....) and inputing all sorts of website API's

I've used Google's and Twitter's API before to built a bot to parse a tweet from a certain user which ultimately sent
a message in a Discord channel to show a pokemon's location in Pokemon Go.

I never knew the magic that went behind RESTful API's until the read so that was a big insight into REST.
