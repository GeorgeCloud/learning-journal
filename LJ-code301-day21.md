This week I have been working with a lot with the backend to handle connections from my postgres database with my front end view index.html file.
I was able to have that application successfully deployed and running on Heroku. Heroku was a huge pain the whole week because of
some internal errors that were far out of my own reach

I was able to learn a lot of the mindset behind the MVC model.
