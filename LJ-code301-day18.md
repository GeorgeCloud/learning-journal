Continuing to build upon the book application. It's now grabbing the data successfully and appending it to the index.html
with a handlebars template. Right now we're just touching on the css styling for the main page and adding some functionality.
The accordion layout was a cool idea that I worked on but it was really time consuming so we decided to abandon the feature.

The week has been going great even though I lost a day because of some Heroku problems and having my partner being sick for a day.
