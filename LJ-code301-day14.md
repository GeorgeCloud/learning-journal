Most of my learning time this week was spent learning new methods and trying to implement them onto old
material. Also getting used to the postgres command-line and the server.js file.

Today on Sunday night I attempted the 2nd UI challenge but didn't know where to start after building the scaffold for the UI.
The only probably I was facing over and over was trying to get the css to appropriately capture the exact pixel on the
sprite image.

I will probably start on the Heroku Reading on deploying an app with the extra time I have today
